# LinkStache
A serverless and buildless "stache" for all your links

## Overview
This is a small static LinkTree clone that utilizes [Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) templating for the layout and style.
It can be set up entirely in GitHub and your browser.
All data for the site is contained in a single `data.json` file with a defined [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/).
Use of the schema 1) allows users to ensure data is formatted correctly and 2) provides an instant GUI editor via [JSON Editor](https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor).

You can see an example using this repository on Github Pages: https://jacobgb24.github.io/LinkStache/
